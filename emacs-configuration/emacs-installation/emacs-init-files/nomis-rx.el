;;;; I looked into fixing these. 2019-07-28
;;;;
;;;; A few points:
;;;;
;;;; They're misnamed -- the args are things that go between [ and ] in
;;;; a regexp.
;;;;
;;;; See https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regexp-Special.html
;;;; - It says "The usual regexp special characters are not special inside a
;;;;   character alternative. A completely different set of characters is
;;;;   special inside character alternatives: ‘]’, ‘-’ and ‘^’.".
;;;;
;;;; You had some assertions around:
;;;; - 93 ; ?]  (an uncommented ?] caused bracket matching problems!)
;;;; - ?-
;;;; - ?^
;;;; - `(aref str 0)`
;;;; - `(rest (string->list-of-chars str))`
;;;;
;;;; It's not easy to check the arguments for being valid to go between [ and ]
;;;; because you can have eg [:alnum:] as part of the arg.
;;;;
;;;; So for now I've given up.
