    ;; Old notes:
    ;;   In projects, you can create a directory-local variable for
    ;;   `cider-repl-history-file` in `cider-repl-mode`, as follows:
    ;;   - create a file called ".dir-locals.el" with this content:
    ;;       ((cider-repl-mode
    ;;         (cider-repl-history-file . ".cider-repl-history")))
    ;; New thoughts on 2019-10-03:
    ;; - If you use ".cider-repl-history" rather than "~/.cider-repl-history"
    ;;   all seems OK, despite confusing (perhaps outdated) comments about using
    ;;   dir locals at the following places:
    ;;   http://blogish.nomistech.com/separate-cider-repl-histories/
    ;;   https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2353#issuecomment-401126801
    ;;   https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/37#issuecomment-7312083
    ;; - So not this:
    ;;   (setq cider-repl-history-file "~/.cider-repl-history")
    ;; But this:
    (setq cider-repl-history-file ".cider-repl-history"))
  (setq cider-repl-history-size 5000) ; the default is 500

 ;; CIDER has `(add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook #'cider-repl-history-just-save)`. But
 ;; that doesn't save history unless the current buffer is the REPL buffer, and
 ;; it also creates an empty ".cider-repl-history" file in the same directory as
 ;; the current buffer's file. This fixes things by changing the current buffer
 ;; to the REPL buffer.
