;;;; ____ * Some rejected (at least for now) ideas

;; XXXX (Too hard! Park this for now.)
;;      Sometimes things take a long time and a busy pointer would be useful.
;;      Why don't you have one?
;;      Emacs is supposed to do this for you.
;;      Some investigation:
;;      - Tested with -Q option:
;;          /Applications/Emacs-26-1-2.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q
;;      - Same behaviour on two Macs.
;;      - There seem to be several problems:
;;        - On OS X, the pointer disappears when typing. You have to move
;;          the mouse to get it back. So even if you fixed this problem,
;;          you wouldn't have a busy cursor when busy unless you moved the
;;          pointer.
;;        - Busy pointer is an I-beam, not an hourglass.
;;        - Busy pointer doesn't appear as soon as it should.
;;        - Busy pointer sometimes sticks until you move the mouse.
;;      - Google not helping -- can't find any mention of this.

;; XXXX Idea of treating level -1 as show only parents, and not siblings.
;;      But first:
;;      - The visibility-span stuff is global, but you have things that work
;;        from point and from root. So you might have to roll your own to o
;;        this.
;;      - Can you detect a parents-not-siblings state? (Remember: you are
;;        no longer storing state for positions. (But you could in this
;;        special case, I guess. But that's getting complicated. It was nice
;;        to get rid of the state.))
;;      - Consider whether there's anything else you might want to do with
;;        visibility.
;;      - Sort out visibiity issues that are mentioned above:
;;        - Bodies not being expanded.
;;        - (Anything else?)

;; XXXX Bug: When a M-x is used to invoke a command (even something not
;;      org-related (such as `version` or `what-cursor-position)`, if the
;;      point is hidden it gets changed to be a visible point.
;;      To reproduce:
;;      - M-x what-cursor-position
;;      - Do something that hides point.
;;      - M-x what-cursor-position
;;        - Observe that point has not changed.
;;      - M-x what-cursor-position
;;        - Observe that point has changed.
;;      So, it seems that after running a M-x command, point gets changed.

;; XXXX When getting to 0 or max, first flash then cycle.
;;      REJECTED
;;      This would give a modal UI. An invisibly-modal UI.
