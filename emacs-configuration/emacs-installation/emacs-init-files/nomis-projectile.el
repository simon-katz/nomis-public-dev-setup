;;;; If a Leiningen project has a ".midje.clj" file, Projectile thinks test
;;;; files have a "t_" prefix rather than a "_test" suffix.
;;;; I think Projectile is confused on two counts:
;;;; - It treats Midje projects differently depending on whether they have a
;;;;   ".midje.clj" file.
;;;;   - Ah, it needs a way to distinguish Midje projects from clojure.test
;;;;     projects, because the `:test` entries in the project types are
;;;;     different.
;;;; - I've never seen the "t_" prefix used in a Midje project (or indeed any
;;;;   Clojure project).
;;;;
;;;; This hack fixes my problem, but might well break things for other people.
;;;;
;;;; TODO Think more about the proper fix for this. Can you just hack the
;;;;      test prefix and suffix?
;;;; TODO-open-source-contribution: Projectile and ".midje.clj" files.
;;;;     - First try to just hack prefix and suffix.
;;;;     - First ask why it's as it is and get agreement on the fix.
