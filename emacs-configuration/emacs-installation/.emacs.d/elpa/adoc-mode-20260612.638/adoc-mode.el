;;; Commentary:

;; AsciiDoc is a text document format for
;; writing short documents, articles, books and UNIX man pages.  AsciiDoc files
;; can be translated to HTML and DocBook markups.
;;
;; adoc-mode is an Emacs major mode for editing AsciiDoc files.  It emphasizes
;; the idea that the document is highlighted so it pretty much looks like the
;; final output.  What must be bold is bold, what must be italic is italic etc.
;; Meta characters are naturally still visible, but in a faint way, so they can
;; be easily ignored.
;;
;; adoc-mode aims to be fully compatible with the modern official AsciiDoc
;; language specification developed under the Eclipse AsciiDoc Working Group
;; (https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang).  Progress
;; toward that goal is tracked in doc/spec-compliance.adoc.

not fontified as titles and so are not treated as headings.  The
region must already be fontified - the heading-navigation commands
and `adoc-imenu-create-index' call `font-lock-ensure' first.

For a one-line title the leading delimiter at START carries
`adoc-meta-hide-face'.  Inline markup in the title text does not
touch that delimiter (so a title made entirely of a macro is still
recognised), whereas a surrounding delimited block repaints the
whole line and thus the delimiter too - which is precisely why a
`==' line inside a block is rejected.  The check therefore relies on
the block keywords winning the face-override war on the delimiter;
the navigation tests guard that assumption.  A two-line title has no
such delimiter, so fall back to looking for a title face on its

  "Returns the face to be used for the given attribute.

The face to be used is looked up in `adoc-attribute-face-alist',
unless that alist is overwritten by the content of
ATTRIBUTE-LIST-PROP-VAL.

POS-OR-NAME identifies the attribute for which the face is
returned. When POS-OR-NAME satisfies numberp, it is the number of
the positional attribute, where as the first positinal attribute
has position 0. Otherwise POS-OR-NAME is the name of the named
attribute.

The value of ATTRIBUTE-LIST-PROP-VAL is one of the following:
- nil
- FACE
- POS-TO-NAME
- (POS-TO-NAME LOCAL-ATTRIBUTE-FACE-ALIST)

POS-TO-NAME is a list of strings mapping positions to attribute
names. E.g. (\"foo\" \"bar\") means that the first positional
attribute corresponds to the named attribute foo, and the 2nd
positional attribute corresponds to the named attribute bar.

FACE is something that satisfies facep; in that case the whole
attribute list is fontified with that face. However that case is
handled outside this function.

An attribute name is first looked up in
LOCAL-ATTRIBUTE-FACE-ALIST before it is looked up in
`adoc-attribute-face-alist'."
