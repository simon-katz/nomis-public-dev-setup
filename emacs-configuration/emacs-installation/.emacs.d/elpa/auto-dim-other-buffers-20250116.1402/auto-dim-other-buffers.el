;;; Commentary:

;; The `auto-dim-other-buffers-mode' is a global minor mode which makes windows
;; without focus less prominent.  With many windows in a frame, this mode helps
;; recognise which is the selected window by providing a non-intrusive but still
;; noticeable visual indicator.

;; # Installation

;; The preferred way to install the mode is by grabbing
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers' package form NonGNU ELPA:

;;     M-x package-install RET auto-dim-other-buffers RET

;; Once installed, enable the mode with:

;;     M-x auto-dim-other-buffers-mode RET

;; To make the mode enabled every time Emacs starts, add the following to Emacs
;; initialisation file (see `user-init-file'):

;;     (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda ()
;;       (when (fboundp 'auto-dim-other-buffers-mode)
;;         (auto-dim-other-buffers-mode t))))

;; To configure how dimmed buffers look, customise
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers'.  This can be accomplished by:

;;     M-x customize-face RET auto-dim-other-buffers RET

;; More options can be found in `auto-dim-other-buffers' customisation
;; group which can be accessed with:

;;     M-x customize-group RET auto-dim-other-buffers RET

;; Highlighting of fringes can be done by removing `fringe' entry from
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces' list.  Either via customising
;; the variable or using the following snippet:

;;     (setq auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces
;;           (assq-delete-all 'fringe auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces))


;; ## Troubleshooting

;; ### My screen is flickering

;; By its nature, `auto-dim-other-buffers-mode' often forces full-window
;; refreshes which may cause flickering on some systems and displays.  To
;; mitigate it, try disabling `fringe' highlighting which—due to Emacs’ display
;; code limitation—require full-frame refresh.  See Customisation section above
;; for instruction how to do it.

;; ### Text which should be hidden in org-mode is not

;; To hide text, `org-mode' uses `org-hide' face whose foreground is set to the
;; background colour of the `default' face.  When `auto-dim-other-buffers-mode'
;; changes background of a dimmed window it also needs to be applied to the
;; `org-hide' face.  The good news is that this is supported out of the box.
;; The caveat is that it requires that `auto-dim-other-buffers' and
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers-hide' are changed in sync.

;; If text which should be hidden in org-mode is visible faintly, the most
;; likely reason is that the latter face has not been updated.  The solution is
;; to customise it via

;;     M-x customize-face RET auto-dim-other-buffers-hide-face RET

;; and set its foreground and background to match background of the
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers'.


;; ## Afterword

;; Note that despite its name, the mode operates on *windows* rather than
;; buffers.  In other words, selected window is highlighted and all other
;; windows are dimmed even if they display the same buffer.  The package is
;; named `auto-dim-other-buffer' for historical reasons.

Windows without input focus are made to look less prominent by applying
‘auto-dim-other-buffers’ to them.  With many windows in a frame,
the idea is that this mode helps recognise which is the selected window

Beware: This mode may cause flickering, especially if fringe changing is
enabled (which is the default).  To mitigate the flickering, try
removing fringe changing (see `auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces').

Note: Despite it’s name, this mode operates on *windows* rather than
buffers, i.e. even if a buffer is shown in multiple windows, only one of
them is considered selected and all other will be dimmed.  Historically,
prior to Emacs 27, all or none windows displaying a buffer would be

  "A list of faces affected when dimming/highlighting a window.

The list comprising of (FACE . (DIM-FACE . HIGH-FACE)) cons pairs.
FACE is an existing face for which a remapping will be added (see
`face-remap-add-relative').  DIM-FACE and HIGH-FACE are remapping faces
which are active in dimmed and highlighted windows respectively.  Either
face can be nil; if they are both nil, the entry has no effect.

Typically, DIM-FACE is either ‘auto-dim-other-buffers’ or
‘auto-dim-other-buffers-hide’.  The former is used when the
background of the face needs to be dimmed while the latter when in
addition the foreground needs to be set to match the background.

HIGH-FACE allows highlighting the selected window, for example as shown
in example below.  Alas, it’s then up to the user to properly set up
faces such that all of the highlighting works.

    (setq auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces
          '((default   . (nil . auto-dim-other-buffers))
            (fringe    . (nil . mode-line-active))
            (org-block . (nil . auto-dim-other-buffers))
            (org-hide  . (nil . auto-dim-other-buffers-hide))))

Beware: inclusion of `fringe' face in the list forces a more expensive
redraw procedure to be used.  This may cause additional flickering on
some systems.  If you’re observing flickering, try removing the `fringe'
entry, e.g. by using code such as:

    (setq auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces
          (assq-delete-all 'fringe auto-dim-other-buffers-affected-faces))

For backwards compatibility, a (FACE . DIM-FACE) format for the entries
is also accepted.  (Although, setting that is not supported through
Customize).

Changing this variable outside of Customize does not update display
state of affected buffers and requires toggling the mode off and on."
  ;; TODO: We’re using (symbol ...) rather than (face ...)  in the type
  ;; definition because the former breaks if the face is not defined.  This
  ;; happens in our case since org isn’t loaded by default and we’re including
  ;; org faces in the default value.
  ;;
  ;; Another aspect of symbol is that it allows nil value.  It’s convenient for
  ;; us in the Remapping part but inconvenient in the Target part.
  ;;
  ;; (face ...) would be better (and we’d use choice between face and (const
  ;; nil) in the Remapping) but for now sticking with the former.
