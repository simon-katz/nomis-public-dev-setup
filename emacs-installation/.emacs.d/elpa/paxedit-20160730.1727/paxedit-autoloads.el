Major mode to enable Paxedit functionality.

Paxedit is an Emacs extension which eliminates the work, tedium, and
mistakes involved with manual editing and refactoring LISP
code. Paxedit allows the quick refactoring of symbols, symbolic
expressions (explicit and implicit), and comments. Normally a unique
command or set of commands would allow a user to delete, copy, or
transpose symbols, symbolic expressions, or comments. Additionally,
after executing some delete or general refactoring commands the user
must clean up any extraneous whitespace, correct indentation, and make
sure all their expressions are balanced.

Paxedit takes a departure from the above manual state of code editing
through automation. Paxedit does away with multiple different
commands. Paxedit knows when it’s in a symbol or a comment. Paxedit
does the right thing in the right context. For example, Paxedit has
one delete command which can be used to delete comments and symbolic
expresions explicit and implicit. That is just one of many Paxedit’s
context aware commands. Additionally, all Paxedit commands by default
cleanup whitespace, fix indentation issues caused by refactoring, and
expressions stay balanced.

Context Navigation:

`paxedit-backward-up' - Move to the start of the explicit expression,
implicit expression or comment.

`paxedit-backward-end' - Move to the end of the explicit expression,
implicit expression or comment.

Context Refactoring:

`paxedit-transpose-forward' - Swap the current explicit expression,
implicit expression, symbol, or comment forward depending on what the
cursor is on and what is available to swap with. This command is very
versatile and will do the “right” thing in each context. See below for
the different uses.

`paxedit-transpose-backward' - Swaps the current explicit, implicit
expression, symbol, or comment backward depending on what the cursor
is on and what is available to swap with. Swaps in the opposite
direction of paxedit-transpose-forward, see forward documentation for
examples.

`paxedit-delete' - Delete current explicit expression, implicit
expression, or comment. Also cleans up the left-over whitespace from
deletion and corrects indentation.

`paxedit-kill' - Kill current explicit expression, implicit
expression, or comment. Also cleans up left-over whitespace from kill
and corrects indentation.

`paxedit-copy' - Copy current explicit expression, implicit
expression, or comment.

`paxedit-sexp-raise' - Raises the expression the cursor is in while
perserving the cursor location.

`paxedit-insert-semicolon' - Insert comment or semicolon depending on
the location (or context) of the cursor. If the cursor is in a string,
comment, or creating a character (?; in elisp or Clojure's ';') insert
semicolon else execute paredit-comment-dwim to insert comment.

`paxedit-wrap-comment' - Wrap a comment macro around the current
expression. If the current expression is already wrapped by a comment,
then the wrapping comment is removed.

Symbolic Expression Refactoring:

`paxedit-compress' - Remove all the extraneous whitespace
\(e.g. newlines, tabs, spaces) to condense expression and contained
sub-expressions onto one line.

`paxedit-dissolve' - Remove enclosing parenthesis, square brackets,
curly brackets, or string quotes. In the case of strings, the user is
prompted and asked if they would like to dissovle the enclosing quotes
since doing so could unbalance the code through introduction of rogue
parenthesis, brackets, and so on.

`paxedit-format-1' -

Symbol Refactoring:

`paxedit-symbol-change-case' - Change the symbol to all uppercase if any
of the symbol characters are lowercase, else lowercase the whole
symbol.

`paxedit-symbol-kill' - Kill the symbol the text cursor is next to or in
and cleans up the left-over whitespace from kill.

`paxedit-symbol-delete' - Delete the symbol the text cursor is next to
or in and cleans up the left-over whitespace from delete.

Debugging

`paxedit-macro-expand-replace' - Expand the current expression in its
place if it is macro.

Whitespace & Indentation:

`paxedit-cleanup' - Indent the buffer according to the rules of the
current mode.

`paxedit-delete-whitespace' - Delete all whitespace to the right and
left of the cursor.
