# To get vterm to work on a new machine:
# - delete the following things (the ignored things after this comment)
# - restart Emacs
# - run `vterm`.
# That will build the following things.
# (The following things have version numbers of cmake and its dependencies baked
# into them, and if they don't exist on the new machine things won't work -- I
# saw Emacs crashing after I copied Emacs config from one machine to another.)
